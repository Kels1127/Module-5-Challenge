Observations:

1.  Ketapril seemed to be the worse of the lowest drug treatments per the bar chart. There really isn't a great different on whether the mouse was female or male to determine if the drug treatments made a difference either. 

2.  The heavier the mouse, the less effective the drug is (see scatter plot). This is a reliable conclusion because of the strong r-value correlation (0.95) resulting from the linear regression.

3.  The results of the study are very consistent, thus reliable, as there is only 1 outlier in the data set for the top drugs, and none for Capomulin.

I developed my code for this analysis by rewatching and reviewing class videos and activities, as well as referencing Matplotlib documentation. The code comments provided were extremely helpful as well!
